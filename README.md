## Library Comissions 

**Development Still ongoing for this project**
Its aim as a development is bringing a blockchain interface for users (libraries), to send a small sum (commission) to some other accounts (book's authors)

There are a few guidelines of where it is meant to head in the src files. This is a complex project (if anything, it has been for me!). Its been an interesting opportunity to learn and explore many concepts.
If you are interested in the project, you can DM at jeremiaspini7@gmail.com If you simply want to say hi, you can say hi too!
