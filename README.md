## Library Comissions 

**Development Still ongoing for this project**
Its aim as a development is bringing a
blockchain interface for users (libraries), to send a small sum (commission) to some other accounts (book's authors)

There are a few guidelines of where it is meant to head in the src files. This is a complex project. The code needs a lot of tests and debugging.
